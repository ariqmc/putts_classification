Classifying whether a golf putt will go in

Putting is one of the easiest aspects of golf to practice but one of the most difficult things to deliver on in sports. When the pressure's on and the money's on the line, it's just you, the ball, the hole, and all the thoughts you can possibly have racing through your mind. This project aims to identify the key factors in predicting whether or not a putt will go in the hole to help make the job of putting a little bit easier.

The data was gathered from stats.pgatourhq.com. It includes every single shot taken over the course of the 2018 PGA Tour season, as well aggregated statistics about each player in the dataset and all the tournaments and events played in the previous season. We may not all be able to putt like the pros, but we might be able to use machine learning to learn from them and improve our own game.

The final model used Gradient Boosting Classification to correctly predict ~87% of missed or made putts.
